Do I Treat This Immigrant?
==========================

A helpful cross-platform website (works with all mobile devices that can
connect to the web) that automatically detects if a doctor in the UK should
treat an immigrant asking for treatment.

The BBC reports that, "Migrants' access to the NHS would be restricted" after
the Queen's speech of 8th May 2013. Jeremy Hunt, health secretary, has
identified that immigrants are clogging up UK hospitals.

Obviously, this application can't come soon enough.
